# Whipupathon - an hour to get something done

A whipupathon is an hour spent creating something. The term came from the
Perl programming language, and specifically from Perl's *whipupitude*,
but you can have a whipupathon in any programming language.

It's basically [time boxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)
to give yourself some focus, and force / encourage you on the deliverable
without getting too hung up on how you get there. That can come later.

I created the first version of the
[CPAN Regular Releasers](http://neilb.org/cpan-regulars/) (CRR) script
in a whipupathon, and will use that to illustrate some of the points.

* Give yourself an hour, with no distractions
* Don't try and do too much. Pick a specific thing and just focus on that.
  My goal with CRR was to create a script that could generate the top 10
  for "once a week", similar to [CJM](http://www.cjmweb.net)'s
  [once a week, every week](http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/current) competition.
* Focus on getting something working as quickly as possible.
  The first version of my script had weeks starting on Monday, and just
  spat out a text list to STDOUT.
* Aim for smaller and complete rather than larger and incomplete.
* If you ship something within the hour, for example releasing a module
  to CPAN, that's a *shipupathon*!
